# THIS VERSION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS WORLD SAVES
## You WILL get missing blocks/items from previous worlds

This is a small update - mainly to fix the language file issues.
There are blocks that are renamed, so expect missing blocks on worlds.

Next update will see ores on existing planets and the remaining 
Trappist 1 planets.
